# compressive-spectral-collocation-diffusion
Code used in the article "A compressive spectral collocation method for the diffusion equation under the restricted isometry property"

The scripts are based on the following Matlab packages:

* OMP-Box
* export_fig

Both should be added to the Matlab path.
