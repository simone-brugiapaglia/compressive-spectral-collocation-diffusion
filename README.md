# compressive-spectral-collocation-diffusion
Code used in the article "A compressive spectral collocation method for the diffusion equation under the restricted isometry property"

The scripts are based on the following Matlab packages:

* OMP-Box (http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~ronrubin/software.html)
* export_fig (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export_fig)

These packages should be added to the Matlab path.
